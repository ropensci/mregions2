  New submission
  
  Possibly misspelled words in DESCRIPTION:
    Marineregions (3:25)
    geospatial (19:42)
    
In this case, these two words are not misspelled in my opinion:

"Marineregions" references to "Marineregions.org", the url to the Marine 
Regions website at https://marineregions.org and it is a common term we use to 
refer to the project. 

"Geospatial" is an term in the English language defined e.g. in the Cambridge 
Business English Dictionary.

Thank you for considering mregions2 to be hosted in CRAN,
Salva Fernández
